# SPQ Modeling using KNN for Classification and Regression problems

Mutagenicity is the property of substances to induce genetic mutation. It is one of the most important environmental, health and safety (EHS) properties to check when dealing with novel chemicals (e.g., drugs or solvents). In this case, we are going to use the data of mutagenicity on Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). This dataset was collected by the Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, merging experimental data from a benchmark dataset compiled by [HMS+09] from a collection of data made available by the Japan Health Ministry within their Ames (Q)SAR project.
